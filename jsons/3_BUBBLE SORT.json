Today we are going to talk about sorting techniques and the second lecture which is on bubble sort. We will understand what bubble sort is, we will do a dry run, we will look at examples, we will look at code, we will look at complexity, time, space, best case, source case, and we will quickly take the point expression and finish it. Done. So let's start with bubble sort and our sorting techniques with the second lecture. We have seen the selection sort in the last lecture and I am sure you have understood it well. Today is the bubble sort lecture and it will be very small, it will be the point and we will tell you what to tell and we will move on. So today we are talking about bubble sort. Now we have to understand what bubble sort is. In sorting, you can consider any of the elements given in the array, we used to call it sorting, we used to say that if we talk about sorted array, what will happen? If I say that it is increasingly sorted, what will happen? It will come in ascending order basically, 1, 6, 7, 9. So if I go to this direction, the elements are increasing. We will give the sorted array, increasing array also can be decreasing. So that's what I understood, sorting is the thing, I have already said about it. Now we are talking about bubble sort, what is bubble sort? First of all, let's try to understand the algorithms, when we say bubble sort, what happens in it? Let's say I have an array, I will make an array for you. So what elements do we have? In this, I will say 10, 1, 7, 6, 14 and we will move one more thing forward. We said that there is another element here, we named it, what will happen? We said that it is 9. So we have kept it like this and we said that we will use bubble sort and show it to me. You said that it will be fine. Like I said last time, there are multiple rounds in sorting, we will show the loops. I have already said the first iteration, round 1, second one, round 2, if I say that round 1, I will show you what will happen in round 1. So I will show you the round 1 once. So you will understand that it is fine, we are basically saying bubble sort. So what did we do? Let's see. So what did we do? We said that don't do anything, just compare the elements of neighbor-neighbor, what does this mean? I said that compare 10 to 1 and see what happens. I am seeing that 10 and 1 are small, so I will swap it. So what did I do in this case? If A is bigger than B, then I will swap it. As you can see in this case, 10 is bigger than 1, so what should be the real position? 1,10 should be there. What is it now? It is 10,1. Is this right or wrong? Okay. So we said first swap it. We did not do this, so swap it. Okay. So what is your array? So what is the array? Now your array is 1,10,7,6,14,9. Now we are moving on to the next iteration. What is the next iteration? We have seen the first two elements, now we are seeing the next two elements. We have seen 10 and 7, so 10 is bigger, so we will have to swap it. Now what is my answer? 1,7,10,6,14,9. Very good. Now I said check the next two elements, you have compared it. Oh man, if it is bigger than 2, then we will have to swap it. Now what did you see? 1,7,6,10,14,9. I said compare it again. You have compared 10 to 14. Now what should we do? First we compared the first two elements, then we did it. Then we did it, then we did it, then we did it. We are moving on to this. You will not understand. Okay. So this is 10, 14 is smaller. What is the case? If A is less than B, like here, 10 is smaller than 16, 14, then we will not do anything. I will ignore it. We have written two rules here. Okay. So nothing. I have ignored it. Now we will go to the next state. What is the next state? 1,7,6,10,14,9. What did we do? We have compared these two elements. Do we have to compare them once? Oh, this is the first condition. I will just staff it. So what will be our state now? 1,7,6,10,9,14. Now if I look carefully, then our array has cleared round 1. Our round 1 is done. What happened? It did not happen. See, it is coming from 7 to 6. So what happened? So what do I say? I say that the round of Jones will be running. In addition, the largest element will be placed. What does this mean? As it happened now, the round number 1 was running. So the first largest element, as you understand it now, the round 1 was running. So the first largest element will come to your right position. Okay. So I say again, if your round 1 is running, then your first largest element, that is, whatever the number of rounds, the first largest element will come to your right place. So first, look carefully, what is this entire array of the first largest element, 14 is coming to your right place. As you understand, then according to each round, your places will be filled. In the first round, it will come out from this place. In the second round, it will come out from this place. In the third round, it will come out from this place. In the fourth round, it will come out from this place. In the fifth round, it will come out from this place. Now if it has come to your right place, it is common sense that you must be here in your right place. So this means that it will be a total of n minus one round. There are total six elements here. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. How is the round? For the first round, the second round, the third round, the fourth round, the fifth round There is no third round because the child element is already in the first place So we have seen that we have to run the total n minus 1 round This is what I understood Now let's take it to the second round and see what happens Fun71610 940 So before the video goes on, let's talk about coding ninja's In this free DSC course, content quality, content expertise, A major chunk of coding ninja has supported till the silica video sponsorship So that you can reach the course Thanks to them, what is coding ninja's?

Because it is already sorted We just saw it That we have placed this element in the same place So we don't need to do anything So what we have to do is, we just have to think about this area Okay, we don't want to run the same algorithm again What did we say? Don't do anything We can compare this and this So see, 1 less than 7 We have 6 places, let's do another one Now what happened to your area? 1 1 7 6 10 9 I am not writing this yet Okay, no need to write this Now what did I say? We have to compare this and this So we have seen that this is bigger than 7 So we have to erase it What happened to our area? 1 6 7 10 9 Now I have compared this to this It is correct It is small It is less than 8 We have ignored it I have written it ahead 1 6 7 10 9 See? See? See? See? See? What did I do? I have compared these two I have compared these two See, the A is bigger than B So I have to erase it here Done So what did I do? Now what happened to my sheet? 1 6 7 And 9 And 10 So this is how my round 2 is completed So here my round 2 This was my round 2 Which is completed What happened in this? This is my second largest element of the whole area Second largest element, let me see So what is the second largest element in this whole area? First largest is 14 Second largest is 10 So here, look carefully So 10 has come to its place 10 has come to its place Now I will remove the 14 See, I have understood 14 14 14 14 Okay? So what you see is that 10 and 14 Both of them have come to their place So this part has been sorted So what did round 2 do? Round 2 placed the second largest element Which is 10 At its place Very good Very good See, I can say this with certainty That yes, this is done Now what did I do? I ran round 3 I said run round 3 Okay, I have removed the element for round 3 What is the element? 1 6 7 9 And these are both sorted 10 and 14 I have put a barrier here So this is sorted See what will happen 2 is about this area Think about it Think a lot Okay, okay From there, we will check these two 1 less than 6 Ignore the model Don't do anything Next, write 1 6 7 9 Check these two A less than V Then again Ignore the model Then again, write 1 6 7 9 Check both of them Again, A less than V Don't do anything Ignore Okay So what happened to my state? 1 6 7 9 I have removed 12 more things 10, 14 10, 14 10, 14 So, if you look carefully My round is 3B done And what happened to me? Now my third largest element Third round What will happen to the third largest element? This whole area See carefully This is the whole area First largest is 14 Second largest is 10 Third largest is 9 So, if you look carefully here 9 is in the right place Very good So, I did it I will mark it in green Okay So, my third largest element is sorted Very good Now, I said let's go to round 4 I said let's go to round 4 Round 4 Write down your area once 1, 6, 7 And 9, 10, 14 1, 6, 7 And this part is already sorted 9, 10, 14 I said, check up to here Check this part This is already sorted You will see what is in it Okay You said okay Let's do it I said, I will compare to 1 and 6 This is 1 less than 6 Ignore it Don't do anything What is the state? 1, 6, 7 I will compare to 6 and 7 Then again, I will do less than 1 Ignore it Don't do anything Okay So, your state is here 1, 6, 7 I have taken all 9, 10, 14 9, 10, 14 What is your round number? Round number 4 That is, the fourth large element If I say the fourth largest First is 14 Second is 10 Third is 9 And what will come here? 7 So, your 7 is in the right place It has come Okay So, I said Your area The fourth large element of the area Has come in the right place So, I will remove it And mark it with green Okay, this part is sorted Very good Now, I said, don't do anything Round 5 Let's go Round 5 Let's go What is the content of the element? 1, 6 And the rest is sorted 7, 9, 10, 14 This is my barrier What does this mean? This part is sorted Don't look at it You just process this part Just check it Okay So, you said, okay, let me see Let me check You said, I will check That is the 6 So, you don't have to do anything Ignore it You came straight ahead 1, 6 That's it One comparison You don't know anything else To do comparison So, what did I know? Let me remove it once 7, 9, 10, 14 The fifth largest If I look closely, it is in this entire area First largest, second largest, third largest, fourth largest Fifth largest, what will happen? 6 6 has come to its right place Now, what I say is that The fifth largest element is 6 It has come to its right place So, this means Brother The processing is done according to round 5 I removed 6 from here I say, this is Now, it is sorted from here Total number of elements is 6 How many rounds have been done? 5, 6, that is 9 minus 1 round So, this means that my entire area is sorted Because the last element will be saved It will already be at its place If these 5 elements If these 5 elements are at its place Then the common sense is It is obvious that the last element will be at its place We will not think about it Because for this, this is the right place This is the place where it is left So, what did I say? The entire area is sorted The entire area is sorted now I said something like this Okay So, you will understand that There is nothing to do in the market We have an area We have done it in a way What are we doing? Just compare the ones in it If the left one is less than B Then they are ignoring it If the A is less than B Then they are swapping it We have to do so much Nothing else See, you will understand the logic What is the way forward Let me code it once So that you understand something And let's start the code Okay Okay The question is in front of you You can see the example you have given We have seen the same thing in it And what did you understand? You understood one thing What is the use of it If I am talking about the bubble sort What is happening So, what is the bubble sort in each and every round In each and every round What do you do? The largest element of the i You reach it in the right place You understood this thing What did we say? We reach the right place in the i-th round This is the use of it As we can say Okay Let's move forward Now I said I have to code it So, it's very good We said it's very simple We said the first thing is That we are running the first round The second round, the third round, the fourth round We are running it by doing it And it is possessing it So, if I say that you have a loop That is showing the round What is the total number of rounds? N-1 So, if I say that it is simple The first round of i-eco is shown This is your first round And how many rounds should we run? N-1 That is, take it to the end And i++ Okay Some people who can start the i-eco from zero And can do i less than n-1 That is absolutely fine There will be no problem in that So, what happened here? We ran it 4 rounds 1, 2, n-1 You understood this Now, what are we doing in every round? What do we understand? We see in every round We go in every round And nothing We start by comparing First we compare Then we compare Then we compare Then we compare Then we leave this Last round is for taste Right? Let's go like this So, watch carefully Let me run another loop Which will start from J We always start from zero Because what we have to do? We always start from the first one By doing this Right? So, the first one is always comparing We started from zero Where are we doing? We are doing What do we say? That we are going like this Going like this Going like this Going like this Then going like this We are going like this So, we have covered all the elements Right? So, for now I have written n in this This is a mistake You will see it later Okay? Now, what did I say? What I have to do? I have to compare this element with this element That is, we have to compare J with the one from J plus 1 Very good I said that F ARR of J If this is big ARR of J J plus 1 So, if this is big What we do? Swap it ARR of J ARR of J ARR of J ARR of J Swap it If we look carefully What we said? We are running the loop We are running it from zero to n minus 1 We are going all the way here But, suppose that I am processing this element When J is here So, J plus 1 So, it will go ahead It will go here until it is existing Until it is running So, this means that I have to run it from zero to here So that when it is here So, this is J plus 1 And this is comparison Okay So, what is this location? This is the location of n minus 1 Okay So, what did I do to it? I did it to J less than n minus 1 Are you okay? It is still a small mistake But, I understood it Let's run it once I said that I will give you an example What if we take an example like this? What did we do? We ran it on the console On the custom test case We ran it Okay It can be done better now We will show you how We ran it Our code went absolutely fine But, this is a mistake We saw it carefully So, what did we see? That our test start was 10, 1, 7, 6, 14, 9 Our test start was 10, 1, 7, 6, 14, 9 Okay This is what we ran our J That is, when we were doing this comparison How many times did we run it? Right? Take it from zero This comparison This is your n minus 1 index And this is your n minus 2 index Right? I know this So, what did we know? That our friend, we ran it from zero to n minus Less than n minus 1 We kept it here And now, it will come to J plus 1 Okay So, you understood that J was from zero to n minus 1 And it ran here In this case Then, what did we know? We knew that one thing has been sorted We knew that at the end of the test There will be 14 And there will be some 5 elements here There will be some 5 elements here 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 Now, we know J We had to run it according to these 5 cases What did we run? We started from zero And now, we went here This index is n minus 3 And this one is n minus 2 This one is n minus 1 We went here So, I saw that Now, I ran it from zero to less than n minus 2 Okay So, in this way, I went to the next round I ran it from zero to less than n minus 3 Okay? So, what I see is that With every round My J is decreasing Because in the first round Your 14 was sorted In the next round I mean, a maximum element has been sorted And then you have to think so much In the next round, a new element will be sorted here And you have to process it In the next round, a large element will be sorted here And you have to process it Your area will be smaller So, your J is at the start of the whole area Then, 1 element is sorted Then, another element is sorted And then, at the end of the rest of the area How do you understand that J is at the start If I show you, here, look How do you understand that J is at the start So, let's take it from 0 to less than n-1. And then, what's your next round? Less than n-2. And then, what's your next round? Less than n-3. Okay, I'll write it down. I'll make a few more looks. That is useless. So, as I said, I used the expression of stars. I used the expression and made four looks. So, I didn't do anything. What do we see? Let's see from here. I said, in the first round, you went less than n-1. Okay. In the second round, you went less than n-2. Okay. The second pattern. Okay. So, you understood the pattern a little bit. Okay. So, you understood the pattern a little bit. What do you see? If I do less than n-i, then my game is already sorted. Okay. If I do n-1 instead of n-i and then run it, then will my code work? Let's see. Okay. If I submit it, then what will it work? Okay. So, I'll submit it. Okay. So, I'll submit it. Okay. So, I'll submit it. Okay. So, I'll submit it. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay? Okay, so we'll submit it. Let's see, that's okay. Let's see. After that by Th plague, what did you look at? We totallng knew the pattern. At that time, if first master of course can know the pattern, then I have fixed. Let's wait and see. So in this case, we take the first loop i and run it to less than n and then to less than n. So I told you that the first loop i and run it to less than n, which is to use 1, 2, 3, minus 1. This is the value. So in this case, I took my j and took it to less than n minus i. So what I told you is that we should think about the rounds before we start. So let's think about the rounds before we start. This is round 2, which means the value of I is 2. Because I is the one we have run from 1 to less than 1. If you assume that we will run from 0 to n minus 1, then your I is going to be 1. So I have run from here, so my I is 2. Now what I said, I said that for I is equal to 2, we are going to run this. So how far will this go? It will go from 0 to less than n minus I. That is, from 0 to less than n minus 2. Index is 2. 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. What is the value of N? N is equal to 6. So what will happen? From 0 to less than 4. Okay, like this. So if I said that if I is your round 2, and you are going to start with I, then from 0. So what will you do in this case? You will compare it with this. What is this? Is this a dash? It is small. It is ignored. Then you said that this is going on for 0. Then you said I is equal to 2 and this is your 1. When your 1 is 1, then what does this mean? It means that your area is 1, 7, 6, 10, 9, 14. So if this is the part, this is the first index. So you have to swap it. You have swapped it. What is the value of this? 6, 7, 10, 9, 14. You said that I is equal to 2 and this is 2. This is 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. So when you are on the index, you have compared it with this. So you have ignored it. You said that you are equal to 2 and this is 3. This is 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. So this is here. So you have to swap it. What is your area? 1, 6, 7, 9, 10, 14. You said that it is okay. I is equal to 2 and this is 4. But what did we know? We knew that we have to go to J less than 4. So we don't need this case. Because J is equal to 4. So our second round is complete. So what happened here? You understand that I am playing this game. 0, less than 4, 0, N minus i. Because I didn't process it. Because I know that the phone 14 is already sorted. If this case comes, I will bring it back. So I will tell you where I am processing. I am just processing here. I know that it is already sorted. So I have done this comparison. I have already sorted this part. So I know that this part is already sorted. So we have looped the N minus i. We have understood the theory of N minus i. We have understood complexity. Let's talk about time complexity. I can see that there is a loop. In which there are rounds. So the first round is N minus 1. So you have to see the comparison. So there is a comparison. So you have to see the comparison. So you have to see the comparison. So the last round is the same comparison. So if I add the complexity of this. So I have to see the comparison. So I have to see the comparison. So this is your comparison. So this is your comparison. So this is your big O of N square. Where N is your size of A. So you will understand this. So you have to understand this. So I will talk about space complexity. So I am going here. I am seeing some variables. So this is the constant space. So your space complexity is constant. So let's talk about the best case and worst case. Before we do that, let's think about the algorithm. So this is your best case. So this is your best case. And worst case. So let's talk about your reverse. So if A has already sorted. We have discussed it. So as a result, N will have the complexity. So let's talk about the best case. why not in this case because b less than c why not in this case because c less than d why not in this case because d less than e so this means a less than b less than c less than d less than e this means what this means this is hot this is hot before doing anything so we don't understand any such round where your number of swap doesn't exist 0 so brother break out don't need to do anything already it is hot so if I have to optimize this code then how can I do it I say I take it on boolean boole swap is equal to false I said nothing about the swap and as soon as I go here I do the swap so I did it I said after doing the swap I said mark the swap I said mark the true and when I come out of this loop I said if swap is equal to is equal to true sorry if swap is equal to is equal to false sorry if swap is equal to is equal to false break out very good let's submit very good so what we can see friends what we did we made a starting variable its name is swapped if you swap something then you can mark the true and when you come out of this loop then you check it out if it is false then it will be false if it is true then it will be false so if it is still false then you have already sorted if I do it properly so I put the break in so it is already sorted so we have optimized it we have optimized it now our sorted case what we are doing is our complexity is of n we have done linear time we have done it instead of of n2 so the best case complexity is of n2 so we have understood one thing we have not learnt if you say first thing in homework you have to understand the n- i game what you have to do once you have to run from i to 0 less than n-1 and then think about j how will j work second thing is it stable or unstable third thing what is the in place sort google it what is the in place sort check if the in place sorting is going on see what is the study so you have understood this and it was fun you will know that in any ith round I am putting it on the right element in ith round you have understood it I will give you one more thing in homework I have put a link below where the quiz is going on which quiz is going on on the bubble sort okay solve it once in the description okay so this is the case it is very important and today contest is also at 7.30 okay so this video will be our next video on insertion sort and after that we will go to the next okay so tell me in the comment section and I have given you a lot of time to cover up the background in the next video time will be there, don't waste time will make good content, it will be fun so this is the time for you to meet bye bye tata see ya"}

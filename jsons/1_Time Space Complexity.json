    "text": " Hello, how are you all? This is Love Babbar and welcome to the channel Code Help. This is our lecture number 11 of our DS series. Here we are going to talk about a very important topic which will be asked after every question of every interview. It has to be talked about. Its name is Time complexity, Space complexity. What is the complexity of time? Why do we need it? What is the reason for it? How are you going to get time complexity? Your time limit exceeded error that you saw in the last video, how can you avoid it? How can you get space complexity? We are going to talk about all those things. Now we have not recursion, so we will not read the time complexity of the recursion functions. As much as we have done the knowledge, according to that, time complexity and space complexity are going to be a little bit more understanding. My plan was to take your dedicated lecture after recursion, but now we are going to read a little bit of our needs, so now we are going to give you a little bit of knowledge on time and space complexity. A dedicated lecture, dedicated lecture, after recursion, it will definitely come. So, in this video, we are going to talk about time complexity and space complexity. We have understood so many things. Very good. The first thing that comes to our mind is what is time complexity? What is time complexity? We understood this. We said it is the amount of time taken by an algorithm to run as a function of length of the input. So, how much time does an algorithm take to run that time complexity? We are seeing time complexity. You have to make a function of the input length. See, there are two things. What is it? How much time does it take? I am going to find out about it and in what form will I find out? As a function of length of input. Done. So, I call this time complexity. I have written an algorithm that tells me whether there is a particular number, prime number or not. Now, how can I say that the algorithm is good or bad? It is slow or fast? How will I find out? If I can tell you its time complexity, its time complexity is not big of n. Its time complexity is big of n square or its n factorial. Based on that, I can tell you that this particular algorithm or this particular program is good or bad. Done. We understood that what is time complexity? We found out that it is the amount of time taken by an algorithm to run as a function of length of the input. We understood that there is nothing like this. We are telling you how much time it is taking. Ok. We have found out this thing. Why? Why do we need it? Why can't we do it without it? If I say your point of view, your point of view is logical. If I say practical, then after every question in the interview, your interviewer will say that what is the time complexity of the code? How much is its space complexity? Can I get a better time complexity solution? Can you optimize it? Can you optimize it? Can you optimize it? Can I optimize it? So, time complexity or space complexity is something that you will be asked repeatedly. Guarantee this. There will be no interview where you are not asked about time complexity or you are not asked about the optimization. Ok. So, that is one reason for your good. But still, if we talk about a good point of view, why? First of all, it is for making better programs. You should know what is good and what is bad. What program will be fast and what program will be slow. So, you will know the time complexity of the code. So, you should know. Let's compare. You have written two algorithms. Which one is better? Which one is faster? How will you know? Suppose I have written two algorithms. Ok. What did I do? This is my algorithm A. So, before we move on to the video, let's talk about coding ninja. In order to reach this free DSA course, we have supported a major chunk of coding ninja through content quality, content expertise, and silica video sponsorship. Thanks to them. What is coding ninja? It is one of the largest codingization platforms where you can give a lot of courses. If you are interested in paid courses, you can do development. You can do machine learning, android, development, sit-in-dan, course subject, OSD, BMS, etc. You can do DSA in Java, Python, in any language. So, you will be able to take paid courses from here. The most beautiful thing that people praise about coding ninja is that there is one-on-one doubt-resolving support available here. If you have any doubt, it will be resolved in one to two hours. The courses that are made are very well structured. If you put in effort, you will get a result. The students who are going to make courses have already broken big companies. So, you don't need to worry about that. If you talk about language, both Hindi and English are available. By solving the question, you will get a hint video. So, if you buy any paid course, then you are sensible. You have this link in the description. You can click on it and take it. And you will get a maximum of 20% discount. Thank you. And this is my algorithm B. Now, I know that there is a lot of processing in algorithm A. I do more processing in it. This is a high processing algorithm. Both work the same. And the low processing algorithm is in the middle. I know that this is fast and this is slow. But how will I be able to tell? I am not saying that it is fast. We should give data point of proof. If we run this fast algorithm on a slow machine, and run this slow algorithm on a fast machine, and now that our output is coming out, we feel that this is the real algorithm. This is the fast algorithm. And this is the slow algorithm. But because of the machine behind the scenes, we are getting slow or fast performance. So, we cannot tell on its basis. And it is a particular fast and slow. So, we have one thing that we will tell on its basis. It is time complexity. I will not tell on the basis of the machine. I will not tell on the basis of when I started and when I ended. So, time complexity is your metric. You can tell it in particular, it is fast and slow. You can compare it. It is very good. What I will show in the scene? I can show it in meters, centimeters, kilometers. There are many units. And I will show it in units. In order to show time complexity, I have big O annotation. I have theta notation, I have omega notation. I have different types of notation. What I am going to use. You must have heard it many times. Time complexity is N. This is N square. This is N square. We talk more about big O. Because big O of notation is up and down. What does it mean? It means that this particular ABCD algorithm will spend so much time on it. This will be the worst case complexity. It will not take much time. For example, I will say that I have a Ferrari. And to reach 100 speed from zero, it takes 6 seconds from the limit. It takes 6 seconds from the limit. It doesn't take much time. I want to give you an example of this type. I have a banana. I have to eat it. I will take more than 5 seconds at max to finish the whole banana. I will not take much. Similarly, if I have something, I want to show you the worst case complexity in the upper bound. I will tell you the complexity of big O. Big O of N, N square, etc. We will discuss this further. If I want to lower bound in the lower bound, it takes at least 3 seconds from zero to 100 speed. It is not talking about Atomax. It is not talking about upper bound. It is talking about lower bound. So, we talk about omega. Let's talk about the average case. Let's talk about theta. We will read about these in depth. Our focus is on big O. It is a practical thing. When we are asked about the things in the paper, we will talk about the placement of the paper. I will talk more about it. I will talk about the time. I don't know how big O notation is a notation. I will explain the worst case. This is upper bound. You cannot do it without time. It will be less than this. But it is not above this. Atomax is this. Now, I have given you an example. It is a constant time. Whenever you consider your complexity, it is a constant time. It will be fixed in time. We will discuss what is a constant time. Suppose I run a for loop. I take it from zero to I10. I have printed it here. Hello. So, it is constant. Because it is going to print hello 11 times. It is fixed. There is no variable in it. It is fixed that it will print hello 11 times. So, the time complexity of this program is constant. How will I show it? I will show it by writing O of 1. I will show it this way. If I change the issue, I will run it from zero to I of n. Okay. The input that you have got here depends on the loop. The variable is done. I showed it in linear time. It is O of n. This way. It is the same complexity as Logan. For example, I take a binary search example. What is binary search? We will read it later. So, it is called log in the midtime. It is n square. Suppose I run two loops. I run the first loop from 1 to n. Then I run the nested loop from 1 to n. This is your example of off n square. We call it quadratic time. Suppose I did n cube after cubic time. So, I run another loop in this loop. So, it is n square. I called it cubic time. This is an example of complexity. There is a complexity like this. You will get a word like O1, O2, n2, n cube, log n. You will be scared. You will think that it is not working. Okay. It is working. I said that you want to see the Viva notation. How are graphs? If I talk about constant time, then the graph will be the same. Okay. If I talk about n, if I talk about linear, then the linear graph will be the same. Okay. n square is the same thing that you have already read in your class. There is nothing new. You will get a quadratic graph like this. You will get a logarithmic graph like this. I have made a table in front of you. This one. I said that the complexity in this table is written. O1 log n, O1, n log n, n square, n cube, 2 power n, n factorial. The complexity is increasing while going up. This is the least complexity in this table. This is the least. And this is the highest in this table. Okay. If you ask me, tell me who is the most complex in n square and n log n. Which means which is the most complex in high processing complexity. So you will say that the complexity of n square is more than n log n. So this table is in front of you. So you will get a better idea of which is bigger and which is smaller. Okay. Let's move forward. Now we are going to give you some functions. Time complexity is the view of this. What is the time complexity of this particular function. Okay. We know that the big o notation is just now read. The big o notation is the upper bound line. So when the upper bound line is being bound, it is explained that you will not go up or down from this. So we, as we gave this function, we ignore the lower degree. Like here we have given the degree 2. Here we have ignored the lower degree. So in this case, the complexity of our table is O of n square. The constant, 1, 2, 3, and the number of times we ignore it. So how do you understand that you have to ignore the lower degree and also ignore your constants. Very good. So your answer is O of n square. I went to this game. I ignored the constant. And this is the lower degree and this is the higher degree. So what is the answer? Okay. I understood this. Here we know that we have seen in the back table that this one is considered as the time complexity and this one is considered as the complexity. So this is n square. So whenever you have the plus, you have to take the option. I will take the maximum of both. So whatever you have to take the plus, in this case you have three things. So whatever is the most complex operation in these three, you can take it. In this, there is a degree 0. In this, there is a 2. In this, there is a 3. We have called it simple. O of n cube. Done. We will not see if we count 1, 2, 3. There is no meaning in 3 or 2. There is no meaning in 5. There is already a number here. The number is fixed. There is no variable. I can write this constant time. I just read it. In this case, I have no meaning in 300. I have written n cube on top. My answer is O of n cube. Q with time complexity. Here, I know n square is bigger than log n. And I do not need to see 5. The answer is O of n square. Here, I know that there is no need to see 4. The answer is linear time. O of n. Here, I can see that leave it. There is a need to see 4 for 3. The number is 3. O of n. Linear time. So you have seen some examples where you will know that I have this kind of function in front of me. I will explain how to get this complexity. I have found out this. You are looking for a very easy thing. You have enjoyed it. I understand this. Done. Let's go. What we have written till now. We have to tell about that. What was that? How will we get time complexity in that? Let's go. I will show you some examples here. Let's try to get the complexity of those examples. Let's go to print area. Let's understand this. Let's go. Let's go. We have seen that what is happening in print area. There is a for loop which is going from 0 to n. And it is printing something in n. So what is your time complexity? It must be n iteration in 0 to n bar. It must be n iteration. And n is the input which will be your length of area. So your complexity is linear here. O of n is here. We have understood this. When we were sitting to reverse, we understood this. How did we reverse? This was our area. You will remember that we had put i here. We had put j here. And we were just going to swap. So this is our first operation. Then we will swap this. This is our second operation. We will swap this. This is our third operation. So we can see clearly that if the area of n length is here. The area of n length is here. Then we will swap n by 2. We will swap n by 2. So my complexity is O of n by 2. But we do not accept 2. So what happened? O of n. We understood this. So our complexity is O of n. Let's talk about linear search. Linear search. What we did in linear search? We had an area of n length. And we had a key. We were looking at that key everywhere. What is it with you? What is it with you? What is it with you? We were checking it. We will compare n to n. How much we have compared? We have compared total n. Or how far we have compared 4 loops? We have compared 4 loops from 0 to n. So how much complexity was there? O of n. We understood this. We understood this. Okay. We understood so much. Now I have picked some things from the intro bit. We will see them once. We will see your time complexity from there. Okay. So the first question is coming to us. The first question is coming to us. What they have said in this? They said that A is 0, B is 0. The first loop is going from 0 to n. Okay. So what is your time complexity of the first loop? N is done. Then there is another loop outside. When there is a loop outside, you will add a plus. And when there is a nested loop, you will multiply it. Understood this. For example, there is one loop like this. And after that, you have added another loop. So what we did is we will add complexity. We will add complexity of O of n. And this will be O of m. So we will add it. This will be O of n plus m. But if this is the case, there would be 4 loops inside. And there would be another 4 loops inside. So here the game is different. Suppose this is n bar. This is m bar. So our complexity n multiplies m. We have to multiply it with the case of nested. And if you have different loops, you will add them. So in this case, we will see different loops. The first loop is going n bar. And the second loop is going m bar. So what is our complexity? O of n plus m. This will be our time complexity. Okay. Now let's move on. We will discuss the space later. Okay. This is our second question. What is shown in the second question? The first loop is going n bar. Good. And there is another loop inside which is going n bar again. So let me write this first. So they have run one loop for 0 to n. Then they have run another loop for 4 loops. They have run from 0 to n. And then they have closed it. I know that this is n bar. So what happened? O of n multiplies n. So we have run O of n square. We have made a good complexity. Now it is not over. There is another loop running. It has run again n bar. It has run from 0 to n. What is its complexity? O of n. Now this was different. So this will be plus. O of n square plus O of n. We know that it has more degrees. So what is your answer? O of n square. This is our complexity. Time complexity. Okay. Let's move on. I have made another question. I have opened this question. What is happening in this question? There is a loop running from 0 to n. Then there is another loop running from n to i. Okay. And you have closed it. How many times is this running? n bar. When you remove complexity in big O notation, then things are very easy for you. You don't have to work too hard. You have to take the worst case. Now how many times will this loop run in the worst case? Look. How many times will this loop run in the worst case? What will be i? Zero. And this is n. This is n bar. And this is a nested loop. So this is multiplied by O of n square. The answer is here. It was a simple thing. You just have to take the worst case. You don't have to take this. Take i, zero, one, two, three, four, three. Take a simple worst case. Take out your answer and give it. Finish. Don't work too hard. It is a simple thing. Okay. So we have seen three questions here. And now what we do? We have made our own questions. Let's see and try them. Once, what will be its complexity? Like we take out this max and minimum. So what did we do in this? We had an area. There were some elements in it. One, two, three, four, five, six. Consider something. It is eight, it is nine, it is fifteen. It is sixteen. We had to tell which is the maximum number and which is the minimum number. What did we do? Nothing. We did max combination with intermini. And then we compared it with each other. We compared it. I will keep updating. We did the whole traverse. We put a loop for the whole traverse. From zero to n. The complexity of n is over. What is n here? Length of array. Good. So we understood some things and now let's try to go back. Let's see this prime function. I ran from two to n. And one loop ran again. From two to n, what does it mean? It means that we ran n minus two. You put n minus two in O. So what is your answer? O of n came again. You got a lot of things. Now you have to remove the complexity. It is coming in the middle. You are counting from one to one. You ran the loop. It is fun. What are you trying to say? You are trying to say that whenever I run the loop from zero to n, whatever I am doing, your complexity will be O of n. No, I did not say that. Whatever you are doing inside, if it is constant n complexity, then your O of n will be there. But if you have given a function call to the inside, let's assume that you have given a function call to the inside. You have given a function call. You have done anything. You have passed the array or passed n, whatever you have done. And you have put some other four loops inside this function. So, your complexity will change. So, when I say four loops, if n comes from four to zero, then your complexity is O of n. That means the inner processing is happening in the constant time. Like, what is happening inside? It is only printing. So, it is printing in the constant time. So, that is why I said that it is O of n. This was the focus. So, let's assume that it is O of n. That means, let's assume that it is O of n. Okay. Let's move on to the next one. So, according to me, you have understood a little bit. Okay, I mean, I can remove the complexity. I have got a little bit of an idea. We will go to full fledged. We will go a little further after the recursion. We will take the full fledged. Now, let's go back. Let's see if we have skipped anything. Yes. So, what is here? We will see the recursive time complexity in the end. We will not see it yet. We will read the recursion after that. We had stuck in the last video in TLE. The time limit exceeded. Your logic is that you are eating more time and we have to work less time. So, how do we know in that case which complexity we have set? So, we have a rule of 10 to the power 8 operation rule. It says that the modern machines at the time of today's time execute 10 to the power 8 operations per second. So, we have to be able to do 10 to the power 8 operations per second. Okay? So, based on that, we can decide which complexity we should put here. Okay? So, to save the TLE, I can put a very nice study here. So, let's see. We had not read the question yet. That, we used to have constraints. I will show you how. We used to have constraints. We used to have N value in between. For example, if I show you, you must have seen this question. I gave you this homework. You read this constraint here. N value is between 5 and 1. You had done this question in homework. You saw that the length of the error is between 1 to 1000. You must have done a pair sum. If I go to this, you must have read that I will give constraints like this. So, based on these constraints, you can decide which algorithm I should put. How? You can decide which one should be given from 10 to 11. The one that you are going to put in the input, based on that input. Based on that input. Based on that input. I told you that N is the value of 10, and 1 is the value of 6. It is between 10 and 6. So, you know that I can put an algorithm of at max, O and log n. I will write it less than this. I will write it for N and log n. So, it will work. But I cannot put any of the above from O and log n. So, you have to put 10 to the power 8. I will have to put linear time or log n. The above will be the tiering of all the above. So, from here you have put a game with a lot of love. I have 3 logic in my mind. But which logic will make all my tests pass in real life? You have a chart for that. 10 to the power 8 operations rule. You have learnt this. You see that we solve the question here. We are solving the lead word or we are solving the code on any platform. So, make sure that we are applying this chart. Is this chart valid? Are you getting help from this chart? Are we able to use it practically? Yes or no? Okay, pay attention to this. When I say that our input can be less than 10 to the power 4. So, what does it say? Put something at max, O of n square. If you put something from these 3, it will work. But if you try from these 3, it will be a tiering. Okay? So, you understood this. Okay, this was it. This is a very nice thing. It is very nice. It will reduce the time you think. Okay, I will apply this. This way, you can avoid the time you are taking the TLE. Okay? Now, if I move towards your space complexity. Suppose I told you that space complexity. There is a program in it. Let me show you the complexity of space. Let's go again. We will discuss this later. We will do a dedicated term later. So, it is not very hard. See, what we have done here is space. What is space complexity? Again, as we said in the time complexity, that you are creating the function of the input and showing it on the display. How much time you are going to take. So, in the same way, you are telling how much memory you are going to take as a function of the length of the input. The memory of the time has come. Okay? So, this is your space complexity. If we see here in the program. So, what space have you taken? You have made a variable A, a variable B. Come, you have made J. When you make a variable, you do not have to worry about it. You have made a variable of 10, 50, and I have made a variable of 50. So, I am not saying that the space complexity is too high. You are making a variable, you are taking int A, you are taking int B, you have left the space complexity. So, the space complexity is considered as O of 1. The constant space is called. Done? It comes into the constant space. We will call it O of 1. Let's move on. In this case, then you have to be careful about the variables. Some people have done something different. Then, O of 1 space has come. Okay? In this case, again, normal variables have come. Again, O of 1 has come. Now, let's go to a case where something has happened. I have written a program. Function. And here I have made an array. If I have made 5 sizes of arrays, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, like this, I have done some O of 1 operations. And done. Now, I am asking you to tell the space complexity. You said that it is too high. I asked you to make an array here. No, I don't. I know that it is fixed size. 5. It must be 5 sizes. I will say it again. O of 1. Nothing. I have explained this. When we have written fixed here, it is 5. So, the thing is over there. We have said the fixed size there. So, it will always come in the constant space. Okay? But if I do this way, I have made an array N. Then, I have made N input. And then, I have made a vector. Vector Int V. And I have given it the size N. Oh, my God. N is a variable. You have created a vector on the basis of this variable. So, how much is the size of this vector? How many are the length? We have given the length of this. N. So, we have created a vector of N length. So, what is the complexity of our space? O of N. Done. I have understood this. If you consider, what I did? I wrote a 4 loop that is going from 0 to N. And then, I have created a vector here. Vector Int V. N size. And I have written another 4 loop that is going from 0 to N. This is all inside. Now, I will tell you what is the complexity of this space. Think about it. This vector is created by the whole space. So, how much is the size of this vector? It is made of O of N size. Then, this whole 4 loop will go. And then, it will come back to its second iteration. It will be created again with scratch. Then, another 4 loop will go. Then, it will come to its third iteration. Then, it will be created with scratch. So, at any particular instant of time, your memory will always be going from N blocks. So, O of N is here. So, don't say that there are 2 4 loops here. Then, I have said O of N square. Otherwise, that time complexity is there. Space complexity is always there. The memory that we have got. The vector will have a memory. The 4 loop will have a memory. The 4 loop does not take memory. The 4 block will have time. The vector will have space. So, it will have space. I will put it in space complexity. Okay. This is a small comparison. You must have understood. Okay. We have created an array. We have created a vector. We have created a vector. We have created a vector. So, let me show you my old program. If you have space complexity in it. Let's try. There is nothing here. If we write a fixed, it will be constant. It will be constant space complexity. It is taking constant space. Same, we have taken it as normal. We have done constant space things. We have not used the vector yet. We will do that too. With time. We have come to know how space complexity works. We have not gone to the depth. I know. We will go ahead. The main intent is that I will teach you the primary search. I will teach you the idea of time complexity. I will teach you the sorting. I will teach you the idea of time complexity. I wanted this. After this lecture, you will get the idea of time complexity. Now, if I come ahead and say that the time complexity of this particular function is O of N. You will say, yes. Go ahead. Tell me more. Okay. I will say that the primary search and its complexity is O of N. You will not be like this. When you see what is the reaction. You will say, okay. So, this is the time complexity. The primary search of space complexity. I will tell you whether you have enjoyed it or not. This is one of our short videos. I think this is the short one. We will meet in the next video. Which will be on the primary search. Let's see what will be on the sorting. Which will come with the whole idea. You will tell me how you want to write in the comment section. I want to tell you that I have seen the entire video in 30 minutes. If you like it, then I will tell you. You can write in the comment section. Okay. See you in the next video. Bye-bye."

This is Love Babbar and welcome to the channel Code Help. Today we are going to talk about a very important topic. It is very important for your online test and your interviews. Because of this topic, you will be asked many questions. If you understand this topic, you will be able to use it. We are talking about binary search. If you don't know, you will be able to teach it in a very difficult way. You will be able to teach it in an additional way. So basically we are going to talk about binary search. Let's start with binary search. When I talk about search, one thing we have already read is linear search. In the second last lecture, we had just read about linear search. When we saw the introduction of arrays, we know that linear search is one thing. What happens? Let's revise it once. So I said that I have this array. Like this. Read this element here. This is the element that we have read. Someone has asked me to search 2. So I said that I have 0 index in the case of linear search. So I started with 0 index. I did not compare with 0, 7, minus 0, 5, 9, etc. It is not a match. There is no value equal to 2. So my 2 is absent. So what did linear search do? I used to compare the value of each block. So I was looking for the value of each block. If there is a value, then return it to the index. If there is no value, then look for the value of the block. So in this way, I used to do linear search. So in linear search, I talked about complexity. We want a forelook of 0. We would check that if the value of the block is equal to 2, then we would have not found the value. In this way, you had written some code in the case of linear search. In the last video, we were on the complexity. So you can see the whole code and you can guess that this is simple. Its time complexity is O of N. So what did you find? In the case of linear search, for the n size array, in the worst case, I compare n. If I say that your array is 1000, that means 1000 values are added to it. And I am trying linear search in this. So what will I do in the worst case? I will be comparing 1000. If you understand this whole song, then you have understood it well. In the worst case, when there is no element present, then I will compare 1000 and then I will say that I did not find the element. So this was my linear search game. Now we already know how to search in linear search. The complexity is good. It is getting linear time. O is BG of N. So what is the need for binary search? Why do we have to study binary search? What is the benefit in this? So this video is sponsored by Reliable. If you want to enter software domain and take good and good jobs, then Reliable is a platform for you. You will get a lot of companies here. If we talk about Crud, 1MG, Misho, Urban Company, Upgrad, you can get a lot of companies where you can get a developer job. If I talk about leaderboard, there are some examples like Harman Preet Singh and Beshwajit Patra. Recently, in Hypto, they cracked back end engineering profile, which has a CTC of 28.5 lakh per annum. If you are going to be a leaderboard, then you will get a lot of replies. We will talk about how to register for tests. You can register for your back end profile, you can register for analytics, business development, there are many profiles here. You can try anything, give tests, there will be interviews, and after you, you will get an offer. You can take all these processes in your first job in 15 days. Get hired. There are many tests here. You have to book your free slot. You have to give tests, crack interviews, and then message me that you got a job. I have given you the coupon code here. You can find the link in the description. And then take as much as you want. Thank you. Now it will be fun. When you talk about binary search, you said that binary search is a very nice topic. Let's take an example first. There are some elements in this. First, you have to keep in mind that binary search only depends on the monotoning functions. Binary search only depends on the monotoning functions. Whether my value is in increasing order or decreasing order. It will be fun. In both cases, I will easily apply the binary search. It doesn't matter. It will be understood as such, but it will be on the monotoning functions. So what does binary search say? You can follow the example. Whatever your elements are, keep them in the monotonic order. Okay. Element should be in monotonic functions. Okay. So I didn't say that. I will show you an example of increasing order. Let's see how it works. I gave you an example. I gave you an example of increasing order. I will apply binary search in this. Okay. I will give you a simple example of what happened in binary search. Then you will start to look a little bit odd. You will be able to do it easily. So, you will have a full fill in the first condition in binary search. It is monotonic function. Okay. First of all, you have to take out your mid-element. So if I index you, then it will be 0, 1, 2, 3, 4. So what is the mid-element? It is 9. So what do I do? When I take out the mid-element, I compare the mid-element with my key. I will have to give an element to search for it. I said that I have to search for 13. Like this. So what did I do? Now I compared this mid-element to 13. Like, is 9 equal to 13? No. Okay. After that, when 9 comes, if I had the same key, then 9 is equal to 9. In this case, it was simple. I would have returned the index of 9. In our case, it was 2. Here it is written 2. So I understood that if it was the same, then what would I have done? What we can see is that there are two parts here. One part is this. And the other part is this. Now if you want to search for me, then what part should I do? I found out that this is 9 and this is 13. So either I will go to this part or I will go to this part. Let's see carefully. What we have to search for is 13. And the mid-element value is 9. 13 is bigger than 9. This means that 9 is going to be on the right side. The small elements on the left side are smaller than 9. This means that I have to search for this part. I don't have to search for this part. Got it? So what we did is, we found out that we have to search for this part. So we have taken this part down. What is this part? 13. 27. This is my index 3. I will remove it from here. And this is my index 4. Now what I did is, I removed the mid-element value. How does it come out? It is simple. Remove your starting index. Remove your ending index. And divide it. The starting index is 3. And the ending index is 4. I divided it into 2. So what is my mid-element value? This one. Because it is 3 here. So I compared my key with the mid-element value. So I compared it to 30. And it is also true that it is 30. So I have to return this index. So what is index? 3. So my answer is 3. Okay. This was my binary search. I understood it a little. Let me explain it again. What we did first is, we removed the mid-element value in the array. How do we remove mid-element? Now we are going to normal flow. We removed the mid-element value. So the first step is find mid-element value. Very good. The second step is compare it to the mid-element value. Okay. On the basis of that, if it is equal, then I have returned the index. If it is not equal, then I have decided which part I have to search. Should I go to the left or the right? And after that, the same thing is going on. The same thing is going on. I don't know what the idea is. I don't understand what the idea is. Let's take another example. Why won't we take it? Let's take another example for you. We told you that this is an array. It is read in this. 3, 7, 11, 13, 19, and 27. I have to do this. My key is 27. I have to search and tell whether it is equal or not. If it is equal, then don't do anything. I didn't eat the mid-element value. I will index it for mid-element value. This is 0 index. This is 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. The starting index is 0. Do you know the formula? What is the ending index? 5. 5 upon 2 is 2. This is the element. This is the mid-element value. I understood it very well. We have compared 11 with our key. It is not equal. We can write it as 11 is not equal to 27. It is 2. The first part is 11 is not equal to 27. It is 2. The first part is 27 is 11. This means that I have to go to the right part. This means that I have to go to the right part. I have to go to the right part. I have to go to the right part. This is 13. 19. The index is 3, 4, 5. 3, 4, 5. It is very good. I have to go down again. I have to do mid-element value. 3 plus 5 is 3. This is 5. 8 upon 2 is 4. This means this element. I have compared 19 with our key. This is 27. 19 is not equal to 27. It is very good. The first part is 2. Which part should I go to? I have to go to the right part. I understood that I have to go to this part. I have to go to the right part. I have to go to the right part. I have written 27. The index is 5. 5. Now I have to go to mid-element. I have to go to mid-element. What is mid-element? S plus B upon 2. What is this? 5 plus 5 upon 2. This is the start and this is the end. The answer is 5. This is the mid-element. I have compared 27 with our key. What is the key value? 27. 27 is equal to 27. Wow! It matched. I have to return the index in this case. I have returned the index. What was the index of 27? It was 5. It is very good. What did we do? We gave the answer 5 at the end. We gave the answer 5. What does 5 index mean? What does 5 index mean? It means 27. We have searched in short 27. We understood this. Okay. You are not doing anything. I told you again that you take out the mid-element. Then you compare the values. Then what do you do? If the part is equal, you return the index. If it is not equal, you decide the part. And then you run the same thing. You are doing something special. You are a very big guy. I understood. I said that I will tell you one more example. I will have to satisfy you. I thought that I will do it. I thought that I understood. You understood me. You will also be there. I took one more example. Let's go to the odd case again. I wrote 4, 8, 16, 22, 34. We have to search. Let's search 4. Our key is 4. Okay. What did we do first? We took out the mid. We have to index it. 0, 1, 2, 3, 4. Start as 0 and have 4. 0 plus 4 upon 2. 4 upon 2. This is our mid. We compared 16 with our key. We said that when 4 is smaller than 16, then the first part will be in these two parts. The second part will be. When 4 is smaller, then we are going to the left part. Now let's take the left part down. 4, 8, indexing is 0, 1. I took out the mid. Start plus and upon 2. Start as 0 and have 1. 0 plus 1 upon 2. 0 is here. 1 upon 2 is 0. Now you have 0. This is your mid element. You have compared 4 to what? With your key. Your key is 4. Your 4 is equal. This is the true condition. You return the index. What is the index? 0. So your answer is 0. Very good. If you consider that my key is 8. Let's see this case. Suppose my key is 8. I have reached this case. So what would I do? 4 is not equal to 8. 8 is bigger than 4. This means you are at this part. You have reached this part. If you reach this part. Now you take it down. This is 8. And this is 1. Very good. You took out the mid. You took out the mid. Start plus and upon 2. Both are the same. 1 plus 1 upon 2. That is 1. This is 1. You have compared your key. 8 is equal to 8. You get true. You returned the index. What is the index? 1. What is your answer? 1. We have seen 3 examples. We have seen 3 dry runs. You have understood it. I will give you one more example. We will not have any element present in this case. I told you that this is your area. This is 5. 7. 17. This is indexing. What are you doing? I want to search 25. Search this. We can see 25. But you should know the value. So what did we say? Start plus and upon 2. Start is 0. And end is 5. Very good. 5 upon 2. This is 2. Ok. So your mid is this. You have not compared it with your key. 13 is not equal to 25. 25 is bigger than 13. So you have two parts. First part is this. Second part is this. 25 is bigger. So I have to know the right part. I have understood this. So I have taken the right part down. What is the right part? 17. 19. And 27. What are the indexes? 3, 4 and 5. Now what did I do? I have put the mid. What will I do? Start plus and upon 2. What is the start? 3 and what is 5? 2. So 8 upon 2 is 4. So your mid is this. Ok. You have made it 19. Now write 19. Not equal to 25. 25 is greater than 19. Ok. So you have two parts. First part is this. Second part is this. Which part will you take? 25 is bigger. So you will go to the right part. I will take it down. Your same number is 27. This index is 5. Ok. You have taken the mid. Mid is equal to Start plus and upon 2. What is the start? 5. What is the end? 5. This is the start and this is the end. 5 is the answer. So your mid is this. You have made it 27. 27 is not equal to 25. You have 25. Less than 27. So you have to go to the left side. But there is no left side. There is no left side. There is no left side. There is no left side. So we have returned minus 1. Like this. If there is no left side. Then it means that I don't know the value. It is not present. Not found. Not found. This is your binary search algorithm. Can I code it? Yes. I will show you. With example. You can take both types of errors. Always remember that we have to take decreasing or decreasing. So what have we made here? We have made a carrier. 2, 4, 6, 8, 12, 18, 3, 8, 11, 14, 16. I have made two variables. I have a function of binary search. I will return an index. I have named it as binary search. What will I have to give in this? First I will have to give an error. Then I will have to give the size of the error. Then I will have to give the key. I have understood this. I have said start. Where will my starting index be? It will always be serious. I have said end. What will be the end index? Size minus. See. This is how much I know. I have taken out the mid. Start plus end. Upon 2. There is a small mistake. I will explain that later. This is how much I have taken out. Now we have to put the condition in the while loop. What was the condition of the while loop? Things are okay until S less than equal to E. Until then everything is okay. As soon as you do not get S, everything is bad. Then you can compare. So our condition is that until S less than equal to E Start less than equal to End. Until then let the game go. Do not run after that. After that when we came here. So we said if ARR of mid Is equal to is equal to key. If it matches. Then return the index. What is the index? Let's move ahead. What can be the next case? If your key is big. What did you understand? Your value is big. So you have to go to the right part. How will you go to the right part? See it is very simple. Here the start was here. And this was here. If I have to go to the right part. Then it is simple. And then this will be the start. I will have to bring it here. And which value is this? I will have to bring the start here. This value is mid. Mid plus one. If I had to go to the left part. Then the start would be there. And end would come here. And how will end come here? With mid minus one. This means when you have to go to the left part. Then end is equal to mid minus one. And when you have to go to the right part. Then start is equal to mid plus one. Simple. I will talk about this case. If your key is big. Then you have to go to the right part. I will write here. I will write here. Go to the right part. Ok. What to do in this? You have to bring the start. Mid plus one. Else. What else do you have to do? Going to the left is simple logic. You said you have to go to the left. So it is simple. And go to mid minus one. Simple. There is one thing missing. Your start is updated. And your end is updated. You have to update mid. Mid is equal to start plus end by two. Done. If you have not searched anything. Then you have done minus one. This is your binary search code. Let me explain you what is this. Here we said. int index is equal to binary search. Search in the even area. Its size is six. And what to search? You can search 12. What should be the answer? C out. index of 12 is You have kept it like this. You have shown it. This is called index of 12 is 4. Let's check. 0, 1, 2, 3, 4. I have made it 18. 18 is 5. Let's see. 18 is 5. Very good. I have made 20. So you should make it 20. Very good. If I have said like this. We have done in even. Let's do it in odd. I have also checked in odd. I have run my function. In odd index. The size of which is 5. Search in it. Search in 8. I have printed it. index of 8 is I have run it. It is showing 8. It is 0 and it is 1. So 8 is 1. I have said 16. Let's see. 16 is 4. Very good. I have searched 20. What will you show? I have not updated. 20. I have made it minus. Your code is running. Okay. I have understood. I have understood. What is written in the code? It is written in the code that start is 0. And n is minus 1. n is the size. And then you can compute the mid. Which will be s plus e upon 2. I have not done this much work till line number 9. You have understood this. Then what have I said? Until. Until. Start less than equal to end or s less than equal to e. What does this mean? Until. Your left side will start and your right side will end. Or your starter will enter at the same location. But it is not like that. The start is ahead and the end is back. This situation is wrong. I have said that while. Start less than equal to end. Do something. We have seen that the mid element. We have compared that. We have compared that. The mid element. I have written that. Array of mid. The value here. I have compared that with key. If I am talking about line number 13. I have checked that they are equal. If they are equal. Then the index here. Return the index. And this index was just called. This index is called mid. So we have returned the mid. Or your key. Will be bigger than this element. So we have to search for the right part. Or if it is smaller than this element. Then we have to search for the left part. Line number 18 says that my key is big. So if my key is big. Then where will I go? I will go to the right part. So here it will end. There is nothing to do. I will have to bring the S here. Which is the location? The one ahead of mid. So you can see. I have turned the mid to plus. Else. Where your key is less than. Array of mid. This condition. If your key is small. Array of mid. What do you know? You know I have to search for the left part. What do you have to do? If we look here. If your key is small. Array of mid. You have to search for the left part. It is simple. And the one ahead. You will bring it here. You know this location is mid. So what happened? Mid is 1. And is equal to mid. Both are understood. Send the same condition to index. Go to the right part. And go to the left part. Now my start and end value. Has been updated. Or has been updated. Or has been updated. So my mid depends on the start and end. I know my mid. Is equal to start plus end. Upon 2. So any value has been updated. Any. I have to update my mid. So my start and end has been updated. So I have to update my mid. So I have updated my mid. Understood. Now I told you. There is one mistake. I will have to search for that. Let's check once. We have done 4 examples. We have done 2 examples. We have seen the code in both the cases. It is going well. Now we can make a mistake. We have written on line number 9. And line number 25. Mid is equal to start plus end by 2. Logically. No problem. But there is a big mistake. It can be a big mistake. I know my maximum value is 2 to the power of 31 minus 1. Suppose. Suppose. The start of the job. Is 2 to the power of 31 minus 1. And the end of the job. Is 2 to the power of 31 minus 1. Suppose. Both are big. So when you will add them. When you have tried to add them. So the value is like this. Which is outside the int key range. Outside the int key range. Do you understand? When you have added them. So the value is generated. Which is outside the int key range. You cannot put such value in integer. Do you understand? So here. Your error will be solved. And you will have to do the test. So here. You will have to play with the mouse. So if you add them. Then the total value can be like this. Which is outside the int key range. So we will have to play with the mouse. So if I write this formula. Suppose. This formula is. The start plus end by 2. So I will write it separately. So I will write it. S plus. And minus S upon 2. So it will work. I can do minus. So this is going to come in the integer range. Do you understand? So this is what I understand. Here we have played this game very well. The start and end are indexes. They will always be positive. So the negative and negative are positive. Don't play the game. The start and the E. Are indexes. 0, 1, 2, 3, 4. They will always be positive. So if I solve this. What will come out? S plus E by 2. So this is the smart thing. Which I can solve with the error. Which will sum up the integer value. Which will give us the problem. So instead of this. I can write this formula. This is called smart. So let's change this. So what does this formula say? What does this formula say? Start plus. End minus. Start by 2. Good. We will have to keep this at line 25. We have kept it here. Oh, oh, oh, oh. Done. Let's see. We have run it. And the answer in both cases is minus 1, minus 1. Because there is no answer in both the cases. For this we will search 6. And in the odd area we will search 14. Let's go. For 6 we have answer 2. And for 14 we have answer 3. Let's see. Ok. We have to update this. We have to write 6. And here we have to write 14. Now let's go. For 6 we have answer 2. And for 14 we have answer 3. So we can bank our code. I will show you again. You have a very nice topic. You should not doubt it. You can use the right index. And take out the mid index. Start plus end by 2. We have modified it. So that our integer and flow will not be the same. Then I said that till the start less than equal to end. I am explaining this to you. Till then you can run this loop. I said that if you match the value of the mid key. Then return the simple index. If your key is big, then go to the right part. And the right part will make the start mid plus. Otherwise, you have to go to the left part. And then minimize the end. Now you have reached the line number 24. So this means that the start will be updated. Or the end will be updated. So if anything happens at the start, then you have to update the mid. If anything happens at the start, then you have to update the mid. So you have to update the mid. Or you have put the formula. This way you have searched your water. If your value is met, then it will return from here. If you come out of this loop, line number 20, do like this. Line number 27, if you come out. If your value is not present in this. Then it will be a simple return minus. Not found. This way you have written the binary search code. What is the benefit of this? I understood. I understood the code. I understood by trying. Example is how it is going. What was the benefit? I told you at the beginning. In the case of the Kibro linear search, if I have an array of 1000 values. Then in the worst case, what do I have to do? I have to do 1000 comparisons. If I talk about the binary search, I have a sorted array of 1000 values. In the binary search, I have to do this case. The size of my array will be 1000. Then I will take the middle and take it to the left or right. Then it will be half. So now when I take the left, I will take the middle and take the left. So when I took the left or right part, If I take any part of it, It will be 500 sizes. Then its front. So it becomes 250 sizes. Then it becomes 125 sizes. Then it becomes It will be 62 sizes. Then it will be 31. Then it will be 15. Then it will be 7. Then it will be 3. 1 and then it is 0 count it 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 ok how many we have to count we will get one value so how much comparison we have done only 10 comparisons we got 10 comparisons we got to know whether this value is present or not so look at the difference here you have to do 1000 comparisons in linear search case here your complexity was of n and in binary search case you have to do only 10 comparisons in array size same, 1000 is the same value 10 comparisons 1000 comparisons are so different how much complexity is made in binary search of log n how does it come we understood that why we use binary search what is our benefit in linear search you have to do all the error travels in binary search you have to play with o log n complexity if you have 1000 length of array then you have to do only 10 comparisons in worst case complexity how much is better how much is better how is log n in starting our array was of n size then you go down you choose left or right part if you go to right part then its size is n by 2 then ok and you take real time so you go down and think of this as left or Middle and is around right is half so you go to wrong part in m yje in my face that means that you played in some way Now you can see the complexity of the search The time complexity of searching an element is log of n The upper bound of the first case is log n Finally, you can see the condition of the search You can see the code after running The complexity of the search is the comparison between the linear search and the binary search How is the benefit of the search The question is There are many questions The application of binary search is very nice If you want to count, you can use the lower bound First, look at the questions What we have learned I have understood the concept of water research. What are you going to do next? There are many questions about water research. It is going to be fun. See, in the next lecture, you can come quietly and tell them. There are many questions. It will be fun. It is a guarantee area. This time it is fun. We are making small lectures. We will meet in the next video. How did it feel to write in the comments? So that I can have fun. What is the time of night? It is 3.56 in the morning. It is 4 in the morning. We are shooting. I have made three shoots of the day. You can see that I have made two videos of the last two videos in the same sweatshirt. I am trying to make good content for you. And tell me in the comments. I have to like it. I have to dislike it. I have to tell the comments. I have to do something. I have to teach you. That is all for now. See you in the next video. With many questions. Till then goodbye. I will work hard. Okay. Ciao."}
